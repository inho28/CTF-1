So the goal of this challenge was to take list of points in 3-dimentional coordinate system and find a largest triangle we can create from these points. I am not gonna pretend here to be a mathematician but fortunatelly google exists. 

I will admit I stole moste of the code from this response: https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/128991/how-to-calculate-the-area-of-a-3d-triangle/1568396

I just had some issues with order of parameters and I didn't get correct solutions at firrst so I used this calculator and few prints to validate my calculations and find the root of my issue.

After this code worked
